Creating Graph-based triangle neighbor objects

The contiguity framework takes the reasonable approach that local implies direct interaction as indicated by shared borders. However in many instances, the odd shape of polygons means that regions could be quite close to one another but not share a border.

A different approach defines the local neighbors by their proximity or contiguity in geometric space. The process subdivides the space into non-overlapping triangles (sometimes called Delauney triangles), using the centroids of each region as vertices in the triangle.

A neighbor is therefore any region that is connected by an edge (link) between two vertices (centroids). More practically, this results in neighbor region that are near(ish) but are not required to have touching-borders. Graph-based neighbor objects are symmetric by design.

I recommend taking a two-step process to creating these graph-based neighbors:

first create the triangle vertices and edges;
second remove extraneous or outlier edges created at study region boundaries by pruning to a sphere of influence graph.
For this and all subsequent definitions of neighbors, we need to know both the sf polygons, and the x,y
 coordinates for the centroid (geometric center) of each polygon. That is because region centroids are used for measuring distances.

Use this code, and look at head(ppor_cent) to confirm that it created what you wanted.

```{r}
# Create a new sf object that holds the x,y coordinates of the centroids:
ppor_cent <- st_centroid(st_geometry(ppor))

ppor_tri_nb <- spdep::tri2nb(ppor_cent) #Requires point geometry
summary(ppor_tri_nb) #Average number of links: 5.773585 
                    #1 least connected region: 36 with 3 links
                    #6 most connected regions: 33 48 50 64 69 121 with 8 links
is.symmetric.nb(ppor_tri_nb) #Symmetric = True
```

Create sphere of influence version of graph
```{r}
ppor_soi_nb <- graph2nb(soi.graph(ppor_tri_nb, ppor_cent))
summary(ppor_soi_nb) #Average number of links: 5.345912
                    #11 least connected regions: 20 25 36 41 50 54 65 74 118 119 125 with 3 links
                    #3 most connected regions: 48 64 69 with 8 links
is.symmetric.nb(ppor_soi_nb) #Symmetry = True
```

3.4 Creating k-nearest neighbors

K-nearest neighbors is a flexible, distance-based approach to assuring balanced number of neighbors, and can help when the size and density of the spatial regions varies across the study area. To create a k-nearest neighbor object, we first must identify the relative proximity of candidate neighbors measured in Euclidean distance between centroids.

This proceeds in a two-step process.

First, the knearneigh() function takes the centroids, calculates all pair-wise distances, and then selects the k
 nearest (or smallest distance) units.
Second, the knn2nb() function takes this information and creates a formal nb object.

```{r}
# 1. Create a k-nearest neighbor object with k = 10 neighbors
knn10 <- spdep::knearneigh(ppor_cent, k = 10) #Requires point (centroid) geometry from st_centroid

# 2. Now take those lists of neighbors and make an nb object
knn10_nb <- spdep::knn2nb(knn10)
```

Force symmetry on k nearest neighbors; required for some statistical methods, breaks rigidity in distance and/or number of neighbors
```{r}
knn10_symmetric <- spdep::make.sym.nb(knn10_nb)
summary(knn10_symmetric) #Average number of links: 11.39623 
                        #49 least connected regions: 5 11 12 13 14 17 20 22 23 24 25 26 27 36 40 41 43 50 51 52 65 71 72 74 77 84 86 90 92 94 98 100 102 117 118 119 124 125 126 128 139 141 143 144 146 147 150 156 158 with 10 links
                        #4 most connected regions: 2 47 54 132 with 15 links
is.symmetric.nb(knn10_symmetric) #Symmetry = True
```

3.5 Creating fixed-distance neighbors

To define fixed-distance neighbors, we use the function dnearneigh() and must define both a minimum distance (probably but not always set at zero), and a maximum distance defining the buffer.

Note that the distance parameters are described on the scale of the coordinate measures of the spatial object. In our case, the spatial object is projected, and the units are meters. Therefore a distance of 1000 is 1 kilometer.

Here we calculate neighbors for a buffer of 50 km surrounding the centroid of each areal unit. To do so requires specification of a minimum (in this case d1 = 0 for 0-meters minimum) and maximum (in this case d2 = 50000 for a maximum of 50,000 meters or 50 km.

The output of each instance of dnearneigh() is not just the distances themselves, but is actually a formal neighbor (nb) object.

```{r}
dist_50 <- spdep::dnearneigh(ppor_cent, d1 = 0, d2 = 50000)
summary(dist_50) #Average number of links: 6.742138 
                #10 least connected regions: 17 20 24 25 43 50 63 65 124 125 with 3 links
                #1 most connected region: 122 with 12 links
is.symmetric.nb(dist_50) #Symmetry = True
```

4 Comparing spatial neighbor definitions

4.1 Visualize a single neighbor connectedness plot

```{r}
# Plot the Queen neighbor connections
plot(st_geometry(ppor), border = 'grey', main = 'Queen')
plot.nb(queen_nb, ppor_cent, point = F, add = T)
```

4.2 Comparing multiple definitions

While the single plot above is easier to see because it is somewhat bigger, you might want to see how the connections or edges change across definitions. In the code below I build up a set of four neighbor definitions. I start with the Queen contiguity, but then I use color to illustrate how each additional definition is different from the Queen definition. Here are some additional comments about what this code is doing:

par(mfrow = c(2,2)) This is a call to the base-R graphics parameter for how an output device (e.g. your screen) should be divided up. By default a plot takes up all of the space. But here we define that we want it to be in a matrix of 2 rows and 2 columns. Note that at end of my code I call this argument again, saying par(mfrow = c(1,1)). This is just good practice to ‘reset’ your graphic device, otherwise the next time you plot it may have strange layout.

You will see four chunks of code following the format of the code above for visualizing each neighbor definition.

The function in the code named diffnb() is simply a utility function to compare two nb objects to determine what is the same and what is different. Again, I contrast each new definition to the Queen definition, coloring the new or different links in red. You could change the referent neighbor definition if you wish.

```{r}
par(mfrow = c(2,2),
    mar = c(.2,.2,1,.2)) # set plotting space for 2 x 2 matrix of plots

# Plot the Queen neighbor connections
plot(st_geometry(ppor), border = 'grey', main = 'Queen')
plot.nb(queen_nb, ppor_cent, point = F, add = T)

# Plot the graph/SOI neighbor connections
plot(st_geometry(ppor), border = 'grey', main = 'Graph/SOI')
plot.nb(ppor_soi_nb, ppor_cent, point = F, add = T, col = 'blue')
plot.nb(diffnb(queen_nb, ppor_soi_nb), ppor_cent, point = F, add = T, col = 'red')

# Plot the graph/SOI neighbor connections
plot(st_geometry(ppor), border = 'grey', main = '50-km')
plot.nb(dist_50, ppor_cent, point = F, add = T, col = 'blue')
plot.nb(diffnb(queen_nb, dist_50), ppor_cent, point = F, add = T, col = 'red')

# Plot the K-nearest neighbor connections
plot(st_geometry(ppor), border = 'grey', main = 'KNN')
plot.nb(knn10_nb, ppor_cent, point = F, add = T, col = 'blue')
plot.nb(diffnb(queen_nb, knn10_nb), ppor_cent, point = F, add = T, col = 'red')


par(mfrow = c(1,1))
```

4.3 Making sense of neighbors

What does all of this mean!!?? Remember your task was to consider what a reasonable definition for ‘local’ might be. When we have fewer neighbors, the information is more hyper-local, but also there may still be sparse data in the prior information.

On the other hand if everyone is a neighbor to everyone else then it isn’t local or spatial anymore! It is just the global (aspatial) smoothing we did last week. So we wish to balance the amount of local variation (heterogeneity) we can detect against the number of neighbors and amount of information in each neighbor. Some simulation analyses have suggested that an approach that ends with an average of about 5-6 neighbors per unit is probably a good rule of thumb.



5 From spatial neighbors to spatial Disease Mapping

The main reason for struggling through all of the preceding ins and outs of spatial neighbors is because we would like to define a reasonable version of local given a spatial dataset, and use that definition to advance spatial epidemiologic goals.

Below we will produce a range of different alternative or competing estimates of spatial variation in feto-infant mortality rate. First, calculate the crude or observed rate, which will be the contrast against which all statistically smoothed maps can be compared.

```{r}
ppor$raw_rate <- ppor$DEATH_TOTAL / ppor$FETOINFANT_DENOM
```


5.1 Calculating the aspatial or global Empirical Bayes estimates

Last week we calculated the aspatial (global) Empirical Bayes estimate of total feto-infant mortality. Let’s just repeat that step to have it as a comparison.

```{r}
# calculate the expected count, assuming each county experience the state referent rate
r <- sum(ppor$DEATH_TOTAL) / sum(ppor$FETOINFANT_DENOM)
ppor$expected <- r* ppor$FETOINFANT_DENOM

# Calculate aspatial EB
eb1 <- SpatialEpi::eBayes(ppor$DEATH_TOTAL,ppor$expected)
```
