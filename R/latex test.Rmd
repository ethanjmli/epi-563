To run this test, click "Knit" on the top left. 

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

library(dplyr)
library(tidyverse)
library(rio)
```

## Create Data
```{r }
x <- data.frame("SN" = 1:5, "Age" = c(21,15, 20, 30, 31), "Name" = c("John","Dora", "Joe", "Denise", "Jamie"))

plot(x$Age)
```

## Types of tests
Let's test some other stuff.
```{r}
#subset to only first obs (since characteristics only taken at baseline)
x2 <- x%>%
         mutate(random = SN + Age)
```
