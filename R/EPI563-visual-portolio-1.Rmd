## Packages

library(tidyverse)

library(tmap)
library(readxl)
library(RColorBrewer)

## Get Data
```{r}
georgia.tracts <- st_read(here::here("Data","My First Map","ga-tracts.gpkg")) #Read in tract data
georgia.life <- read_xlsx(here::here("Data","My First Map","GA_A.XLSX")) #Read in life expectancy data
```

## Clean and Reproject Data
I renamed all variables from life expectancy to match the variable names in the tract data
in order to improve ease of reading and consistency across datasets. I also leftjoined the smaller 
life expectancy data into the larger tract dataset in order to preserve data before reprojecting
```{r}
georgia.life <- georgia.life %>% 
  rename(GEOID = `Tract ID`, STATEFP = STATE2KX,COUNTYFP = CNTY2KX,TRACTCE=TRACT2KX) #Rename variables to be consistent between datasets

georgia.tracts.life <- georgia.tracts %>% #Left join life expectancy --> tract geometry 
  left_join(georgia.life,by = "GEOID")

georgia.tracts.life <- st_transform(georgia.tracts.life, crs = 5070) #Reproject merged data to CONUS Albers

```

## Map 1: Life Expectancy by Tract
This map uses quantiles in order to place breakpoints for data symbolization. I opted
to use a sequential color palette where the lowest LEs are symbolized as red and the highest
as cream colored. I did this in order to better highlight the areas of most concern, i.e. the
areas with lowest life expectancy.
```{r}
tm_shape(georgia.tracts.life)+
  tm_fill(col = "e(0)",
          palette= rev(brewer.pal(n=4,name="Reds")),
          title = "Life Expectancy (years)",
          breaks = quantile(georgia.tracts.life$`e(0)`,na.rm=T),
          textNA = "No Data"
  )+
  tm_borders(lwd=0.1)+
  tm_credits("Data Source: U.S. Small-area Life\nExpectancy Estimates Project",
             position = c("LEFT","BOTTOM"))+
  tm_scale_bar()+
  tm_layout(frame=F,
            main.title = "Life Expectancy in Georgia Census Tracts",
            main.title.size = 1.2,
            legend.outside=T,
            inner.margins = c(0.1,0.02,0,0))
```


## Map 2: Life Expectancy by County
This map also uses quantiles for symbolizing data breakpoints and uses the same
color palette as the tracts map in order to ensure consistency and ease of comparison
across different maps.
```{r}
georgia.county.life <- georgia.tracts.life %>% #Aggergate tracts into counties by grouping by county name and averaging by LE
  group_by(CTY_NAME) %>%
  summarize(`e(0)_avg` = mean(`e(0)`,na.rm=T))

tm_shape(georgia.county.life)+
  tm_fill(col = "e(0)_avg",
          palette= rev(brewer.pal(n=4,name="Reds")),
          title = "Life Expectancy (years)",
          breaks = quantile(georgia.county.life$`e(0)_avg`,na.rm=T),
          textNA = "No Data"
          )+
  tm_borders(lwd=0.3)+
  tm_credits("Data Source: U.S. Small-area Life\nExpectancy Estimates Project",
            position = c("LEFT","BOTTOM"))+
  tm_scale_bar()+
  tm_layout(frame=F,
            main.title = "Life Expectancy in Georgia Counties",
            main.title.size = 1.2,
            legend.outside=T,
            inner.margins = c(0.1,0.02,0,0))
```

## Summary Table Min/Max
I extracted the maximum and minimum life expectancies by summarising both tract and
county level data down to their maximum and minimum values. I added the variable geo_unit
in order to keep track of which values corresponded to which type of geographic unit, then
rowbound them in order to make it easier for me to visualize.
```{r}
georgia.county.life.minmax <- georgia.county.life %>%  #Get the maximum and minimum life expectancy among all counties
  summarise(maximum_e0 = max(`e(0)_avg`,na.rm=T),
            minimum_e0 = min(`e(0)_avg`,na.rm=T)) %>%
  mutate(geo_unit = "County") %>%
  st_drop_geometry()

georgia.tracts.life.minmax <- georgia.tracts.life %>% #Get the max/min LE among all tracts
  summarise(maximum_e0 = max(`e(0)`,na.rm=T),
            minimum_e0 = min(`e(0)`,na.rm=T)) %>%
  mutate(geo_unit = "Tract") %>%
  st_drop_geometry()

georgia.life.minmax <- rbind(georgia.county.life.minmax,georgia.tracts.life.minmax) #Rbind max/min datasets
```

Geography  | Maximum LE | Minimum LE
:----------:|:----------:|:-----------:
County    | 80.975   | 71.8
Tract | 87.60 | 63.3


## Summary Top 5/Bottom 5 Counties in Life Expectancy
To extract both top and bottom five counties by life expectancy, I sorted the county
level data by descending LE values, then sliced out both the first 5 and last 5 rows.
I then turned the column containing LE values into a list and named each entry as the corresponding
county. 
```{r}
georgia.life.topbot5 <- georgia.county.life %>% 
  arrange(desc(`e(0)_avg`)) %>% #Arrange county life expectancies by descending life expectancy value
  st_drop_geometry() %>%
  slice(head(row_number(),5),tail(row_number(),5)) #Slice out top 5 and bottom 5 rows

georgia.life.topbot5.list <- as.list(georgia.life.topbot5$`e(0)_avg`) #Create list of top/bottom 5 LE
names(georgia.life.topbot5.list) <- georgia.life.topbot5$CTY_NAME #Assign county names to corresponding LE values
georgia.life.topbot5.list #Display list
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars, eval=FALSE,include=FALSE}
#summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, eval=FALSE,include=FALSE,echo=FALSE}
#plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
